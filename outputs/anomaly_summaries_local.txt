📏 Length Growth Analysis:
• Average length is decreasing at 0.63 mm per year
• Range: -8.13 to 2.60 mm per year

📐 Width Growth Analysis:
• STABLE: Average width change is minimal (0.18 mm per year)
• Range: -26.83 to 4.86 mm per year

⚠️ Risk Assessment:
• 11 anomalies (0.6%) are classified as high-risk
• Average risk index: 0.042

💡 Recommendations:
• Continue regular monitoring schedule
• Focus on anomalies showing accelerating growth trends

PERIOD 2: 2015 to 2022
================================================================================
Pipeline Integrity Analysis: 2015 to 2022

📊 Overview:
During the 2015 to 2022 inspection period, 448 pipeline anomalies were successfully matched and tracked across both ILI runs.

🔍 Depth Growth Analysis:
• CONCERN: Average depth is growing at 0.63% per year
• 25 anomalies (71.4%) show depth increase (deterioration)
• Range: -0.57% to 3.86% per year

📏 Length Growth Analysis:
• CONCERN: Average length is growing at 2.16 mm per year
• 27 anomalies (75.0%) show length increase
• Range: -4.03 to 21.15 mm per year

📐 Width Growth Analysis:
• STABLE: Average width change is minimal (0.13 mm per year)
